# myorm

MyORM is a library dedicated for interacting with a MySQL database by building transactions using an Object Relationship Model (hence the name `myorm`)

# Table of Contents

# Overview

This library was built in JSDOC TypeScript, however, for readability sake, TypeScript is used in all examples, accompanied by any (applicable) SQL statements that are generated from the respective code.  

All examples are from the `chinook` database. More details on the `chinook` database can be found [here](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/sample-data/chinook/#:~:text=About%20the%20Chinook%20database,from%20an%20Apple%20iTunes%20library.).

If you'd like to set up the chinook database schema for testing or exploration, please follow the instructions on how to [setup chinook](#tutorial-setup-chinook-database) on your local machine.

## Chinook Database

The Chinook database comprises of eleven (11) tables that represent Entertainment media. Although, some, or most, of these records that are in the default snapshot of this database may be out of date, you can still use them to learn SQL in its entirety.
